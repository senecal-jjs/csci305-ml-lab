Lab Questions
=======================
1. I get the output: val it = [4,2,5,2,6,10] : int list

2. The function "f" adds 1 to each element of the input list.

3. In line (* a *), the function uses the empty list as a pattern, returning an empty list if
   the empty list input pattern is matched.

4. In line (* b *), (x::xs) matches any non-empty list. 1 is then added to the head of the list,
   and the function is recursively called on the tail of the list, until an empty list is encountered.
